1. **Linters and Code Quality Checkers**:
   
   - **flake8**: A popular Python linting tool that checks your code against coding standards like PEP 8. It also has several plugins available to extend its functionality.
   
   - **pylint**: Another Python source code, bug, and quality checker. It offers more checks than flake8 but is also more verbose and opinionated.
     
   - **bandit**: A tool designed to find common security issues in Python code.
     
   - **mypy**: A static type checker for Python. Helps catch type errors before runtime, given that Python is dynamically typed.

2. **Security and Dependency Checkers**

2. **Security and Dependency Checkers**:
   
   - **safety**: Checks your installed dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
   
   - **pyup**: A service that continuously updates your project's dependencies and sends pull requests whenever a dependency is outdated or has known vulnerabilities.

3. **Error and Crash Monitoring Tools**:
   
   - **Sentry**: A powerful error tracking platform that can be integrated with Django (and many other platforms) to capture and analyze runtime errors and exceptions.
   
   - **Rollbar**: Like Sentry, it's used for real-time error monitoring and alerting.

4. **Performance and Optimization Tools**:

   - **Django Debug Toolbar**: Provides a set of panels displaying various debug information about the current request/response, helping during the development process.
   
   - **Silk**: A live profiling and inspection tool for Django. It intercepts and stores HTTP requests and database queries before presenting them in a user-friendly UI.
   
   - **nplusone**: Helps to detect the n+1 queries problem in Django, which can be a common performance pitfall.

5. **Testing and Coverage**:

   - **pytest**: A popular testing framework for Python, which can be used with Django projects to run tests and generate reports.
   
   - **coverage**: Measures code coverage of Python programs, helping ensure that your tests are comprehensive.

6. **Continuous Integration Services**:

   - **Travis CI**: A CI/CD platform that can run tests, linters, and other checks whenever you push to your repository.
   
   - **GitHub Actions**: Provides CI/CD capabilities directly within the GitHub platform, allowing for automation of workflows, including testing and deployment.
   
   - **CircleCI**: Another CI/CD platform that integrates with popular VCS platforms and allows for complex workflows.

7. **Django-specific Linting**:

   - **django-lint**: A tool for flagging potential issues in Django applications.
